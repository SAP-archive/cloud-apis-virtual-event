# Using APIs on SAP Cloud Platform

## Description

This repository contains the material for a virtual event all about using APIs on SAP Cloud Platform.

Prerequisites and recommendations are documented in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### Virtual event overview

In this virtual event, you'll get to know how to find, understand, authenticate for and use APIs on SAP Cloud Platform. It covers discovery via the SAP API Business Hub (and other locations), authentication with different OAuth 2.0 grant types and practical advice, through direct hands-on experience calling APIs from various endpoints.

### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises that are to be done in order (each one building on the previous one). Each exercise is contained in a directory, with a main 'readme' file containing the core exercise instructions, with optional supporting files, such as screenshots and sample files.

### Following the exercises

During the virtual event you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise there are questions; these are designed to help you think about the content just covered, and are to be discussed with the entire class, led by the instructors, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

:point_right: Where there's an action for you to perform, it will be prefixed with this pointing symbol, to help you focus on where you are in each exercise.
