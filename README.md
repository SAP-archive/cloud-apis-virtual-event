# Using APIs on SAP Cloud Platform

## Description

This repository contains the material for a virtual event all about using APIs on SAP Cloud Platform.

Prerequisites and recommendations are documented in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### Virtual event overview

In this virtual event, you'll get to know how to find, understand, authenticate for and use APIs on SAP Cloud Platform. It covers discovery via the SAP API Business Hub (and other locations), authentication with different OAuth 2.0 grant types and practical advice, through direct hands-on experience calling APIs from various endpoints.

### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises that are to be done in order (each one building on the previous one). Each exercise is contained in a directory, with a main 'readme' file containing the core exercise instructions, with optional supporting files, such as screenshots and sample files.

### Following the exercises

During the virtual event you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise there are questions; these are designed to help you think about the content just covered, and are to be discussed with the entire class, led by the instructors, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

:point_right: Where there's an action for you to perform, it will be prefixed with this pointing symbol, to help you focus on where you are in each exercise.

### The exercises

Here's an overview of the exercises.

**Some basics**

In these first two exercises, you'll get a basic understanding of what APIs on SAP Cloud Platform look like, and also get an introduction to important OAuth 2.0 concepts which are fundamental to using the APIs.

- [Exercise 01 - Get an overview of API resources](exercises/01/)
- [Exercise 02 - Understand OAuth 2.0 at a high level](exercises/02/)

**Learning with the Workflow API**

In these next two exercises you'll get your feet wet with the Workflow APIs. First, you'll set up a dev space in the SAP Business Application Studio (App Studio) with some extra tools, then you'll create a Workflow service instance and deploy a simple workflow definition. Through trial and error, you'll learn about scopes, the contents of access tokens, and become familiar with a few different Workflow API resources.

- [Exercise 03 - Setting up your dev space in the SAP Business Application Studio](exercises/03/)
- [Exercise 04 - Creating a Workflow service instance & deploying a definition](exercises/04/)
- [Exercise 05 - Workflow API calls, authorities, access token contents & more](exercises/05/)
- [Exercise 06 - Calling the Workflow API from within the SAP Business API Hub](exercises/06/)
